CHANGELOG

v0.4.1:     2005-05-13
 
  - Fixed bug in Save PDF function.

v0.4  :	2005-05-12

  - Fixed some bugs in german and spanish translation.

v0.3.1:	2005-05-06

  - Added language support for Japanese.

v0.3  :     2005-05-03

  - Changed the service used to convert pdf to html. Now the extension don't use Adobe service anymore, because it	
    didn't work always. Now the PDF to HTML conversion works always (depending only on the web server up-time).
  - Changed support for local PDF files, because as made before it was pointless. Now my extension doesn't care about 
    local files, because if you have a pdf file in your local filesystem you shouldn't need to open it from a html page!
  - Added language support for Spanish, Romanian, German and French.

v0.2.6  :   2005-05-01

  - Added new functionality: now it is possible to know the PDF file size that you are going to save or view.

    version of the PDF file using the online conversion service provided by Adobe. 

v0.2.4  :	2005-04-29

  - Added language support for Italian, English and Swedish.
  - Improved the dialog box that appears when you click on a pdf file link. Now it's 
    possibile to choose if you want to download the file, view it or if you just want 
    to cancel the operation.
  - Added support for link with pdf filename as parameter inside the url.
    Example: http://www.google.it/search?hl=it&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Ait-IT%3Aofficial&q=test.pdf&btnG=Cerca&meta=


v0.2.3:	2005-04-28

    click annoying the user in some cases, but now it captures only the left mouse click.
